Chihiro nervous
I always get so nervous on the first day. What if no one likes me?
Those hall monitors are so scary!_Apparently they show up and attack if you spend too long of a time on any single floor.
This is a 3rd line.
Don't forget to show me a camera.
Also this one!






























































































It's not nice to tease girls, you know._I know a boy like you could never fall for me.
You probably say that to all the girls.
